# Robotic Arm - Pick & Place

![header](img/readme.png)

## Project Objective
In this project, I'll train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation and then issue commands to a drone to follow that target. 

So-called “follow me” applications like this are key to many industries and the techniques you apply here can be extended to other powerful scenarios like adaptive cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration.

## Result
This project is still under development. Stay tuned.
