# Udacity-Robotics
These are work and projects I developed as a part of [Udacity Robotics Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/robotics).

## Relevant Projects
You can also view my [self driving car projects](https://github.com/Michael-Tu/Udacity-Self-Driving-Car) and [computer vision projects](https://github.com/Michael-Tu/Udacity-Computer-Vision). 

These projects include but not limited to traffic sign classifier, end-to-end learning/behavioral-cloning, lane line detection, and vehicle detection & tracking.


## Environment Setup
Make sure you have Anaconda installed. Then, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install all necessary packages needed for all my projects.

If you have issues installing packages, get more instructions [here](https://github.com/ryan-keenan/RoboND-Python-Starterkit).
